                                <h3>The Search Begins</h3>
                                <img src="../img/samweber.jpg" alt="The Sam Weber band" class="img-responsive">
 								<p>My assignment was simple.</p>
  									<p>I was to write an artical about Rifflandia 2015, a music festival taking place in Victoria, BC. But when you hire Ryan Aldred nothing is as simple as it seems. It was the last festival of the season and I knew that all the burnouts who hadn’t quite burned out would be there.</p>
  									<p>Among them, members of the watermelon cult. and that was the true purpose of the assignment, I had been working on a piece about them for years and the last piece of the puzzle was to identify their leaders.</p>
  									<p>“It’s a regular Woodstock” one PTA mother yelled at a public hearing. “We can’t let these monsters have another festival, think of the children!”</p>
  									<p>Fortunately Rifflandia could not be stopped by PTA mothers	, regardless of how angry they were. Rifflandia had too much force behind it, too much momentum. It was like a boulder crashing down a hill, it could not be stopped.</p>
  									<p>The department had tasked Feather Van Duck to be my assistant (they seemed to think I couldn’t handle it on my own). She was known to be a top notch editor (Lord knows I need one.) At least she looked in a dress and had an eager will-do attitude.This would either prove to distract me or help me get closer to the Watermelon Cult leaders, the jury was still out.<p>
  									<p>What ensued was 4 days of eating out, shotgunning Lucky Lagers, raving, rock concerts, savage allergy attacks, and good old fashion hangovers. I went thru all of this for the sake of getting the story.</p>
  									<p>Feather and I were going over our notes in the department assigned Eurovan enjoying cold beers. All of a sudden, it occurred to me that we didn’t have a photographer!</p>
  									<p>How could we report on a music festival without a photographer! I called the department in a fit. “How could we report on music without a photographer!” I shouted. Didn’t they understand that the way a musician looked was just as important as how well the music sounded.</p>
  									<p>They told me not to worry, they had a photographer on another project working the same festival, I planned to meet up with him and coordinate.</p>
  									<p>I cracked another Lucky, and offered one to Feather. She was still on her first one. Feather and I made a game plan and polished off a few more Luckys, then we left the van in a discreet parking lot.</p>
  									<p>Upon leaving, we ran into the photographer Maw, he was hanging around the surf venue, He claimed to be busy taking pictures, then he was gone , off the catch another act elsewhere. We didn’t even get the chance to coordinate!</p>
  									<p>We were headed to the Victoria Event Center, to see Sam Weber. Eight years ago I remember Sam’s older brother Graham complaining about Sam always practicing the same chords, over and over again. I guess it paid off..</p>
  									<p>The Victoria Event Center was a shabby little place with a big piano against the wall and a fully stocked bar. Feather and I were posted up against the bar.</p>
  									<p>Sam opened the weekend nicely, his voice strong and passionate. Feather thought he was self-centered because the band’s name was Sam Weber and there was clearly a band on stage with him.</p>
  									<p>The next band to play were the Gay Nineties, Feather was mixed up about the schedule, she was very confused as to why the band on stage was playing Gay Nineties songs when the Gay Nineties were supposed to be up next.</p>
  									<p>It’s ironic that my “assistant” couldn’t keep track of the schedule, but I figured maybe the booze was getting to her. We left the Victoria Event Center before the second Gay 90’s band was set to take stage. There was no sign of the Watermelon Cult anyways and I sure as hell wasn’t willing to watch another band play Gay Nineties songs. </p> 
  									<p>I dragged Feather to the van for another beer. “It’s essential” I proclaimed! We were about to head into the bowels of the beast. Surely we would find signs of the cult at a place called Capital Iron. </p>
  									<p>"Here, do you know how to shotgun?” I asked “we don’t have the time to sip these, we’ve got a story to catch” I punctured a hole in the bottom of a can and handed it to Feather, then I did the same for myself. To my amusement and utter disbelief, she finished her beer before I finished mine. Sadly, I didn’t even finish mine, we noted as I poured the remains on the ground.</p>
  									<p>We headed to Capital Iron, the line was short but security was tight, I was full on frisked by a tall, bald and jacked man. Jillionaire was playing out of the Red Bull party bus.</p>
  									<p>Jillionaire is one member of the group Major Lazer, you know, the ones with that catchy song Lean On. </p>
  									<p>“Remember when you were young, we walked down the sidewalk.” Deep Lyrics, I know!
  									</p>
  									<p>Well, he rocked, hard. First of all, it should be said that the Capital Iron venue was not in or behind Capital Iron. In fact it was across the street in the Capital Iron parking lot.</p>
  									<p>Sadly, we were the only freaks to be found.</p>
  									<p>The alcohol had taken its toll and I was debilitated to the mental state of an eight year old boy. Feather tried to keep me on point, “Remember the story!” she begged. But you can’t reason with the unreasonable.</p>
  									<p>I picked her up and spun her around. All in all, it didn’t matter, the story wasn’t here and we had three more nights to find it. Now was the time to relax and take it all in.</p>
  									<p>Jillionaire set was sick, we danced hard but not for long. A few songs after we got there, he was done and the venue had shut down for the night! </p>
  									<p>“Come on,” I said dragging Feather by the hand, “there more beers to be drunk in this town!” I wanted to check out Carmana, a local indie group. They were at the Copper Owl, I place I once visited with my friend Gosh the summer before. Although I had been there before, I didn’t really remember the place, must have been the booze again.</p>
  									<p>There was a line to get in at the Copper Owl, Photographers and VIP skipped the line but the bouncer wouldn’t let us in, despite us having had Super Passes. “What’s the point of having a Super Pass if it doesn’t get you?” I asked Feather in disappointment. I decided I would have a talk with the department over this fiasco. And where the hell was our photographer?!</p>
  									<p>All I remembered about the Copper Owl from my previous visit was that you couldn’t take your beer downstairs when you went to the bathroom. I learned that lesson the hard way when an unremorseful bouncer confiscated my nearly full beer.</p>
  									<p>We sat down at the bar and ordered drinks, the place was so packed that the crowd was louder than the speakers. We moved closer to hear the band.</p>
  									<p>Carmana needs to break up, literally! The band is a couple singing love songs back and forth to one another. (Although they weren’t very happy love songs) They’re more like, “you deserve moooooreeeeee,” she repeated as the band played sadly behind her.</p>
  									<p>We finished our beers and left, unimpressed, atleast we didn’t get our beers taken away at the stairs this time.</p>
  									<p>We debriefed in the van. </p>
