                  <img src="../img/rifflandia.jpg" title="Brother Photography" alt="rifflandia 2015" class="img-responsive">                  
 									<p>I woke up in a haze.</p>
 									<p>It was 7:00 am. We needed to pay for parking. The lot we had parked our van in cost $4.00 for the night but it expired at 6:00 am. After that, it cost an additional $5.00 for two hours of parking. I was glad to pay.</p>
 									<p>I went behind the van to take a piss against the wall. Behind the van was a pile of human shit and some toilet paper. I cursed the French hoodlums that had been camped on the ground next to our van last night.</p>
 									<p>I crawled back into the van and told Feather about the shit behind our van. She looked perturbed. By 9:00 am we had the blinds pulled back on the van. We had to drive to where my car was parked to pay for more parking. The front window was covered in condensation but we drove off anyways. For breakfast we went to Mole.</p>
 									<p>Feather got scrambled tofu with extra avocado. I got the chinese sausage breakfast bun and coffee. Lots of coffee. I noticed a wrist band on the arm of our waiter. A fellow rager, most likely feeling the effects of the night before like we were. I was glad to be sitting at the table nursing my hangover with coffee rather than be in his shoes.</p>
 									<p>On my way home, I was hit with a debilitating allergy attack. Snot poured out of my nose like a cranked faucet. I sneezed 20 times a minute. Feather thought I was getting sick, and maybe I was, but I denied it completely. At my home, Feather made me a cup of tea and I took some medicine.</p>
 									<p>We soaked in the hot tub and went over our notes as our hangovers passed. Feather had to go to school, it was Friday, after all. The girl was doing a degree in Biology in her spare time! To say the least, she had spunk.</p>
 									<p>I wanted to get a start on my piece for the department but I was rendered useless by my allergy attack. Snot continued to drip from my nose. </p>
 									<p>Our plan was to check out the main stage at Royal Athletic park, Chromeo was supposed to close the night but he had succumbed to a stomach flu. The Arkells stepped up to fill Chromeo’s slot. Clearly there was something nasty going around.<p>
 									<p>Upon entering Royal Athletic Park, we ran into Feather’s friend, then we went to buy beers with the tickets we had purchased the day before. To our surprise, our night beer tickets were no good! We needed day beer tickets to buy a drink.</p>
 									<p>“It’s dark out!” I argued, but it was no use.</p>
 									<p>We left the beer vendor, got in line to buy beer tickets, got ID’ed again despite the fact that we were wearing ID bracelets, got new ID bracelets, bought daytime beer tickets, went back to the beer line, then, finally, we got our beers.</p>
 									<p>The stench of bureaucracy was palpable. </p>
 									<p>Tonight’s theme was Fruity Friday. Feather figured only people with banana suit would be dressed up. She was pretty much right, although, I did see one guy with a watermelon rind on his head. </p>
 									<p>Feather was wearing a bandeau with an airy beach shirt and thin, psychedelic pants. They sat high on her waist and were baggy. They ever so gently wrapped around her butt, just enough for me to notice. Her blonde hair shimmered in the light and her makeup was on point! In honour of Fruity Friday she wore orange lipstick.</p>
 									<p>I was wearing nothing special and my back pockets were stuffed with Kleenex just in case the faucet turned on again. I enjoyed watching the Arkells. They even played one of Chromeo’s songs, Jealous. I bet Chromeo was feeling pretty jealous of that.</p>
 									<p>Neon Steve and A Tribe Called Red were closing out the night. It was sure to be a blast and I was hoping to find some more clues, quite frankly, the trail had run cold.</p>
 									<p>The base echoed up the street from the Red Bull tent at Capital Iron. I really liked that about Rifflandia, you could hear music playing all throughout the downtown core at night. It was as if the city had come alive for the festival.</p>
 									<p>The line to get into the venue was already long, spanning halfway across the parking lot. I insisted on stopping at the van for a drink before we joined the queue.</p>
 									<p>“Okay, let’s shotgun two Luckys.” I said. </p>
 									<p>Feather shook her head no. </p>
 									<p>“Okay, shotgun one Lucky and sip another.” I revised. Again she denied. Tonight, Feather was focused on the mission. </p>
 									<p>“Okay, we’ll shotgun one Lucky each, and share one to sip on.” I had found common ground because she agreed. Once again, Feather shocked me when she finished her shotgun before I did. I joked that she must be better at relaxing her throat than I was. We threw our empty cans cans into the van and left for Capital Iron.</p>
 									<p>The line to get in was longer than before and much more hectic. The trifecta of booze, drugs and bass were fueling a raving frenzy and we were still only in the line! </p>
 									<p>Feather hates lines and so do I. Even worse is when a giant bald man tells you to spread your legs a little further while he frisks you before you can enter. Feather reports that she was full-on boob grabbed by the female frisker.</p>
 									<p>My mind jumped to Bill C-51 and the State of Security but I pushed it aside. Tonight was all about that bass.</p>
 									<p>Applecat was still on the Red Bull stage when we got through security. I decided I would pee and buy two more beers before things kicked off. Feather, also having a child’s sized bladder, was keen to join me.</p>
 									<p>It had started raining lightly. On the West Coast it’s called a dry rain when it’s just misting. The raindrops were lit up the spot lights. We figured the best spot to watch the show was front and center of the tent. We would be under cover from the rain and perfectly situated in the middle of the speakers and lights. </p>
 									<p>When Applecat finished her set, lots of people left the stage. We slid through the thinning crowd all the way to our ideal location. The energy was electric and I was stoked. </p>
 									<p>Neon Steve entered the stage and the crowd was once again packed in. I saw signs of the Watermelon Cult throughout the crowd. I knew we were in the right place. </p>
 									<p>The night before was merely a warm up. Tonight, you had to dance to keep your place. It wasn’t hard though, Neon Steve whipped the crowd into a full on jam fest. Strawberry, blackberry and raspberry jam was flying in all directions. A fool with giant shoes was crowd surfing. His foot got dangerously close to Feather, I instinctively gave him a push and he went flying.</p>
 									<p>It wouldn’t be the last crowd surfer I pushed away that night. Feather looked so nice that I didn’t want anything to wreck her hair or her vibe.</p>
 									<p>The front of the Red Bull bus featured a giant geometric face. As the lights flashed over it, it looked like it was animated. It was a very cool face.</p>
 									<p>A girl got up on the shoulders of a guy nearby us and flashed Neon Steve, I didn’t want to stare for Feather’s sake, but I couldn’t help but notice. Later, a girl made out with another girl, Feather and I looked at one another and laughed.</p>
 									<p>I heard one guy tell another guy that he didn’t want to be the one to get between that. Everybody was drinking the Kool-aid tonight. </p>
 									<p>Our photographer reached out of the crowd and tapped me on the shoulder, he snapped a picture of the two of us and ran off back into the crowd.</p>
 									<p>After Neon Steve’s set was finished we ran through the crowd to the bathrooms and back to the beer line. There was a guy off to the edge of the venue, he was wearing a red and white poncho and had long black dreadlocks. He was twirling around in his poncho like a little girl in her princess dress. I stared for a moment but decided not to think about it too deeply. </p>
 									<p>A Tribe Called Red took things to another level. Feather noted that there were a lot of First Nations people gathering in the crowd. They had come out to support their boys. A Tribe Called Red is a Native-Canadian trio that blends traditional sounds with electronica. They call their unique sound Powwow Step.</p>
 									<p>A Tribe Called Red blasted their audience with chanting drum and bass that couldn’t be resisted. Everybody was bouncing around. In the window of the Red Bull bus, I noticed a guy wearing a headband playing with hula-hoops. I asked Feather if this was some sort of genius marketing done by Red Bull but she strongly doubted it.</p>
 									<p>During a particularly powerful moment of a song the headband wearing hula-hooping man burst forth onto the stage and laid down some sick hula-hooping. The crowd went nuts. </p>
 									<p>The strobe light had the most amazing effect on Feather’s pants. Because of their pattern, she appeared to be moving in slow motion, I was completely enchanted by this psychedelic effect. </p>
 									<p>A Tribe Called Red closed the night in a brilliant blend of modern and traditional. The hula-hooping man hooked the hoops into a chain and laid them across his back. When he flapped his arms, you could easily picture him as an eagle flying around.</p>
 									<p>The lid blew off the crowd as the DJ’s dropped the bass one final time. It was a crescendo of auditory, visual, and dancing delight!</p>
 									<p>Feather and I went and got pizza from the Joint before we retired in the van for another night.</p>
