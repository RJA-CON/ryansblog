 									<h3>A New Beginning</h3>
                  <img src="../img/theropershow.jpg" alt="the roper show" class="img-responsive">
 									<p>Waking up in a van, in a parking lot in downtown Victoria is quickly becoming a normal thing.</p>
 									<p>I wake up at 7:00 am again, which is odd because no alarms are set. I get out, pay for parking, with Feather’s credit card this time. Then I take a piss behind the van and remark that it’s going to be a good day, mostly because there’s no shit on the ground behind the van this time. Then I crawl back inside the white cocoon of warmth, safety, and all things holy. </p>
 									<p>Laying in bed I dream about raving to Neon Steve and A Tribe Called Red, it was magical. Everybody was immersed in this world where work, bills, and responsibilities don’t matter! </p>
 									<p>Then I chuckle about the couple we saw fooling around on the grass in front of us. Here we were, eating our pizza, legs dangling off the side of the wall overlooking the inner harbour, when a couple walks down onto the grass in front of us and starts making out.</p>
 									<p>Feather suggests we give them their privacy but I counter that we were here first. We decide to stick around. We can’t actually see anything but I can tell by the way the guy is proudly looking down at himself that he’s got his dick out.</p>
 									<p>Then her head starts bobbing up and down over his crotch. Four teenage boys walk on the nearby path (completely oblivious to the fellatio) and sit down right in front of them on the lower wall overlooking the water. </p>
 									<p>We eat our pizza and look out into the water. Not much later, two guys walk within three feet of the lust-driven couple and don’t say a single thing or even look down at them! The couple leaves, I assume they are headed for greener pastures. We keep eating our pizza.</p>
 									<p>I break out of my reverie. Pulling back the blinds in the van lets the sun shine through the condensation. Actually, it’s not sunny at all, it’s a classic west coast day. It’s grey and cloudy; nearby seagulls caw the way they do on grey cloudy days in Victoria.</p>
 									<p>Feather and I go to the Red Barn Market to get sandwiches. I order a “Bun on the Run” breakfast sandwich and she gets her classic veggie sandwich with hummus and guacamole. We eat breakfast at my place, then Feather heads home to clean up and get a new outfit for tonight.</p>
 									<p>I go for a bike ride, I need to clear my head. I love riding my bike, it’s simple yet challenging. It’s relaxing enough to let my mind wander but engaging enough to keep me focused. I do some of my best thinking on my bike.</p>
 									<p>I am seriously beginning to doubt the validity of my assignment. What’s so wrong with the Watermelon Cult. Yeah, people are doing drugs and occasionally a foolish teenager OD’s but does that outweigh the benefits?</p>
 									<p>I mean, personally, I feel fucking ecstatic right now. All the worries of regular life seem like an afterthought. I feel good and I really don’t give a damn about the department and their bureaucratic bullshit!</p>
 									<p>And Feather, oh goodness, Feather is such a dime. Feather’s the best thing to ever come through the department. What happens if I leave, would Feather join me as an accomplice? Would she really follow a mad man on his mission when he no longer has credible backing?</p>
 									<p>I put all these thoughts aside and focus on the ride. There are dump trucks and cars whizzing past me.</p>
 									<p>Today I catch a ride into town. Feather keeps pushing back our meeting time because she’s waiting for her pants to dry. I gotta hand it to her, she’s got resolve. I would’ve grabbed another pair of pants, but once she sets her mind to something, that’s the way it’s going to be.</p>
 									<p>We get to the R.A.P. Main Stage just as Big Data is taking the stage. Feather’s sister has a ticket for the day and caught a ride into town with us.</p>
 									<p>“We are Big Data! Have you given us all your information yet?” the lead singer of Big Data asks the crowd through the microphone. </p>
 									<p>I look at Feather. “They must work for the Watermelon Cult,” I say. </p>
 									<p>I make a mental note to never sign up for any Big Data mailing list.</p>
 									<p>There’s a female singer on stage, Feather informs me that she’s a guest singer but she could've fooled me. Her vocals blend in perfectly with the melodies of the band. They start playing their hit single Dangerous. </p>
 									<p>I love that song when I hear it on the radio. I always feel like I’m riding dirty, like I’m dangerous. It’s a good song, you should look it up if you’ve never heard it. There’s a great video on Youtube for it.</p>
 									<p>After Big Data collects all of our information we head to the Rifftop tent at the other end of the park where Neon Indian is playing. His sound is pretty out there but I enjoy it. The Watermelon Cult’s presence is glaringly obvious here.</p>
 									<p>Behind the stage is a giant slice of watermelon! At this point I don’t care, I’ve decided to experience the day free from the department’s dogma. I want to experience the Watermelon Cult as an unsuspecting outsider. </p>
 									<p>However, I never stay in one place for long and I’m quick to drag Feather by the hand to the beer garden for some drinks. The line is short, the beers are as cold and fresh as an already poured beer can be. We head back over to the main stage for Tokyo Police Club.</p>
 									<p>They’re alright, they sound exactly like they do on the radio. Which is good. There’s nothing worse than a shitty sounding live band. In my opinion, it screams of corporate fuckery and is one of the main problems with today’s music industry. <p>
 									<p>They play all their hit singles and I drink my beers, perfectly content to just stand there and watch, the night is still young. </p>
 									<p>Kiesza plays at the watermelon stage while they set the main stage up for Modest Mouse (a band I’m stoked to see because I was a huge fan when I was younger). Kiesza and her backup dancers are on point with their performance.<p>
 									<p>It’s quite entertaining, but Feather, her sister, and I are hungry, so we leave in search of the perfect meal for a omnivore, a vegetarian, and a vegan. We want Tacofino but they are out of beans! We run into my friend Sam, he’s waiting for his Tacofino. I tell him I’ll catch up with him later because I know better than to get between hungry girls and their food!</p>
 									<p>We check out every other food truck, sadly there are very few food carts with vegan options and even fewer with yummy sounding ones. </p>
 									<p>In my mind I fantasize about starting a food truck and travelling the festival circuit, making food for the happy festival-goers. The fantasy is short lived because I soon find myself back in front of the Tacofino food truck trying to order food from an irate employee.</p>
 									<p>Not only are they out of beans, they're also out of patience and professionalism. I quickly learn why, it’s because they have a shitty system. He takes our name and doesn’t even issue a receipt. He says they’ll call out my name when our food is ready.</p>
 									<p>There’s at least 25 people standing around waiting for their food, including my friend Sam. We chat until his food is ready and his name is called, but there’s a problem. It seems there’s another guy named Sam waiting for food. Sam and Sam argue about whose food it is. Eventually they determine it’s my friend’s food. When the problem isn’t two people with the same name, it’s when people don’t hear their name being called. Tacofino needs a loudspeaker. I begin thinking I can hire myself out as a consultant if things with the department don’t work out.</p>
 									<p>We get our beanless burritos and watch the last bit of the Kiesza show, I laugh when I discover that she’s the one with the song Hideaway. That song with chorus that goes “ooooo, ahhhh, ooooo, ahhhh”. I never thought I would see her live, not intentionally, at least.</p>
 									<p>The final act at the R.A.P. stage is Modest Mouse, it’s the moment we’re all waiting for, and to be honest, it’s a sort of disappointing. The lead singer must not be that good because they have his microphone turned down low. The lyrics of the songs can hardly be heard over the band.</p>
 									<p>I like the melodies to a couple of my old favorite songs but Modest Mouse is actually pretty modest and mousey.</p>
 									<p>They did come out for an encore but we’re already on our way to the van. Kytami is set to take the stage in the backyard of the Phillips Brewery and Feather says she is not to be missed.</p>
 									<p>By this point, we’ve had a couple of drinks so we enlist Feather’s younger sister to drive the van back to our parking lot. She has her learner's permit but just failed the test to be able to drive on her own, apparently she doesn’t make left turns well.</p>
 									<p>I devise a route to get us to the parking lot that involves only right turns, while Feather hides on the ground. My “right turn only” route gets us to the parking lot safely.</p>
 									<p>I crack a beer and offer one to Feather’s sisters but she says she doesn’t like Lucky.</p>
 									<p>The Phillips venue is 19+, Feather’s sister can’t go so we run down the streets in the rain to get her to the bus stop in time. I don’t want to think about what will happen if she doesn’t catch the bus.</p>
 									<p>Back at the van we drink a couple more beers, then head to the Phillips venue. I get frisked on my way in but this time I’m told it’s for my own safety. So I thank him.</p>
 									<p>We get as close to the stage as we possibly can. Kytami takes the stage and I’m  immediately transported to another place. Kytami is an electric violinist, she plays the violin to electronica. Her performance is amazing!</p>
 									<p>She blesses the audience with violin set to rap lyrics, fast paced drumming, and bass. I would have never imagined that the combination would be so good but it was better than any performance I’ve seen so far.</p>
 									<p>Feather and I dance to this terrific sound along with the rest of the crowd. Beers are drank and doobies are passed around.</p>
 									<p>Kytami is the most charismatic performer we’ve seen! The entire time she’s running around the stage, dancing to the beat as she lays down the violin, smiling from ear to ear. Her black hair flies through the air in all directions with every jump, turn, and drop of the bass. </p>
 									<p>It’s the greatest show! If she works for the Watermelon Cult, I’d gladly drink from the fruit punch! But this is the Phillips Backyard, there’s no way she does, so we go and grab a couple of Phillips finely crafted beers instead between acts. </p>
 									<p>The next band is Five Alarm Funk, I’ve never heard of them but it doesn’t matter because I’m so stoked off Kytami. The stage is set up in a very odd manner. They have a drum kit front and center of the stage and two smaller drum kits to either side.</p>
 									<p>Five Alarm Funk is a massive band! There’s like 12 of them, three brass players, three drummers, a keyboardist, a bongo player, and a bunch of guitar and bass players. The lead drummer is also the lead singer. He’s a hairy, shirtless man wearing sweaty old gym shorts.</p>
 									<p>They are quite funky to say the least. I actually really like their tone and voice, it’s like they’re just jamming on stage, it feels like it’s partly planned and partly free flowing. At one point the sax player and lead drummer got into a music battle of epic proportion. </p>
 									<p>The sax player has a crazy mustache and mop of long silver hair, like an old werewolf. Five Alarm Funk is on a mission to spread the funk and they have a very serious mantra for us. When they say, “May the funk be with you!” We reply, “and also with you!” </p>
 									<p>My personal favorite is a song about washing people’s faces. The crowd ate up their upbeat and rambunctious sound.</p>
