                  				<img src="../img/mothermother.jpg" alt="Mother Mother on stage at Rifflandia 2015" class="img-responsive">
                  				<p>I don’t know why, but I always feel better on the last day of something than I do on the first few days. Whether it’s camping, hiking, or in this case, a festival. Perhaps I enjoy late nights, early mornings, and running myself into the ground.</p>
                  				<p>Today being the last day of Rifflandia 2015 is no exception. I feel euphoric and in my zone. We get up early today and Feather drops me off at the bus stop and drives off. On my bus ride home, I go over the weekend in my head.</p>
                  				<p>The shows we saw on Thursday feel like a lifetime ago, the importance of my department’s assignment feels irrelevant and the wickedness of the Watermelon Cult doesn’t feel that wicked. My life has been turned upside down, and all that remains is Feather and I.</p>
                  				<p>A warm fuzzy feeling rises up from the bottom of my seat when my mind drifts to Feather. </p>
                  				<p>I get off the bus and walk the rest of the way home, I shower, make breakfast, and hangout for a little bit then I am back out the door to catch a bus into town.</p>
                  				<p>The Roper Show plays today at 3:00 pm and I will not miss his show!</p>
                  				<p>I meet Feather at Uptown, I sneak up behind her car and bang on the glass, she yelps, and jumps in her seat. </p>
                  				<p>She says she was expecting me to come from the other direction. “Around me, you’ll learn to expect the unexpected,” I say.</p>
                  				<p>We drive to Royal Athletic park just in time to catch a little bit of the Towers and Trees show, we leave before the end of the set to get a couple of drinks and find a good spot to watch The Roper Show.</p>
                  				<p>It’s an overcast day again. There’s some blue sky off in the distance but there’s also a dark ominous cloud off in the other direction.</p>
                  				<p>Jesse Roper and his band get on stage and I am instantly enthralled. Jesse and the boys are a band of hooligans. If they weren’t up on stage rocking out right now, they’d probably be in someone's garage, backyard, or living room doing the exact same thing.</p>
                  				<p>They’re really just up there having fun doing what they love to do. Jesse runs around the stage, jumping up and down laying down sick licks, the drummer rocks the rhythm and the dude on the harmonica leaves nothing to the imagination.</p>
                  				<p>I really enjoy The Roper Show. There’s no stuck-up pretentiousness to them, it’s pure fun and the crowd is totally buying into it.</p>
                  				<p>It’s Tie Dye Sunday and when you look out into the crowd it looks like a scene from Woodstock. The Watermeloners blend in among a sea of psychedelic colours and patterns, except for one guy whose outfit takes things to another level. </p>
                  				<p>He’s waving a large tie dye flag around, wearing a giant black afro wig, and a full tie dye jumpsuit. He is clearly stoked on Kool-aid.</p>
                  				<p>During The Roper Show’s final song this flag carrying, afro wearing, tie dyed man runs out from behind the back of the stage and starts waving his flag around like he just stormed the beaches of Normandy.</p>
                  				<p>During one final rock out, Jesse Roper runs up and sticks his head between the flag waver’s legs while laying down a solo. The band finishes up and Jesse thanks Hype Man for hyping up the crowd, then they leave the stage.</p>
                  				<p>At this point, the day can go one of two ways. Having eaten so little I already feel a good buzz from the music and the two beers. It’s only 4:30 in the afternoon but to keep this buzz going I know I’ll have to keep drinking at a steady pace all day. </p>
                  				<p>I decide it’s been a good few days of boozing and today I’ll just enjoy the music. The next band to play is Tacocat at the watermelon stage.</p>
                  				<p>We get there, listen to one song then walk away. Not my jam. Feather and I go and get a falafel wrap from the Coast Lunch Box food truck to split while we wait for Hollerado to take the stage. </p>
                  				<p>Hollerado sounds good but after Jesse Roper it’s just so apparent that they are trying too hard. The whole band is wearing different coloured pyjama onesies and they feel rather uptight. It’s a good set but Jesse Roper already set the stage and stole the show.</p>
                  				<p>Emancipator plays at the alternate stage between sets. Feather has never heard of Emancipator, I tell her it’s pretty chill electro music. When the set is over, she agrees.</p>
                  				<p>Next up on the main stage is Joey Bada$$ and I am sad to report that he is not so badass, or a very good rapper for that matter. Being from New York I am sure he is used to a different crowd than the one in front of him today in Victoria at Rifflandia. </p>
                  				<p>It’s a pretty chill afternoon, it’s been raining off and on and it’s the last day of the festival. He comes out like it’s Friday night. </p>
                  				<p>Can I get a whaaaaaattt!!”</p>
                  				<p>“Throw ya hands up, throw ya hands up!” again and again. Honestly, it’s painful for me to watch and I’m sure he’s not feeling it either.</p>
                  				<p>After four songs he runs out the back of the stage while the dj changes songs. Nothing happens for a few minutes. Then Joey Not-So-Bada$$ runs back on stage and starts screaming into the microphone with the intensity of a man who just railed a mountain of cocaine.</p>
                  				<p>The climax of Joey Not-So-Bada$$’ set is during his final song when he calls a bunch of girls up on stage. Not one of them has a beer garden wristband on signifying they’re at least 19 years old.</p>
                  				<p>We walk away laughing at the ridiculousness we had just witnessed.</p>
                  				<p>In less than an hour, Mother Mother is set to close the festival. I’d seen Mother Mother play once before at Rock The Shores. It was the first time I had heard them play and I really enjoyed it, they’re out there but very polished.</p>
                  				<p>Feather and I split another burrito from Tacofino but they’re out of beans again, so we get extra guacamole to compensate. </p>
                  				<p>At 7:00 pm we work our way towards the front of the main stage. Within 10 minutes it packs in. Elbows are flying and there’s an endless stream of late-goers trying to sneak through the crowd to get closer. </p>
                  				<p>“That’s the leader of the cult,” Feather says as a man dressed in a grotesque purple tie dyed outfit walks out onto the stage.</p>
                  				<p>“Hello Rifflandia!” he says in a gnarly British accent. “Are you excited for Mother Mother?!” The crowd cheers. I notice that the pupils of the guy standing in front of me are as large as his eyeballs through his sunglasses. The cult is all around us.</p>
                  				<p>“I said, are you excited for Mother Mother?!” he repeats, clearly not hearing our answer the first time.</p>
                  				<p>This whole time I’ve been looking for this fucker and now here he is, right in front of me. He’s so close but so far, it’s impossible to move in this crowd, everyone’s taken up a bracing stance to prevent anyone else from sneaking forward. </p>
                  				<p>I can’t move, if I could get to him I could take him into the department and be done with this damned assignment, but it’s futile. The purple ring leader of the Watermelon Cult walks off the stage and the lights go down.</p>
                  				<p>The crowd cheers, Mother Mother walks out onto the stage. Without saying a single word they pick up their instruments and start playing a song. In the background I see a helicopter fly off along with the Watermelon Cult leaders.</p>
                  				<p>I look at Feather with dismay, she grabs my hand, intertwines her fingers with mine, and smiles at me. It doesn’t matter anymore, I relax and enjoy the show. A group of teenagers try to start a mosh pit in front of us.</p>
                  				<p>Mother Mother plays song after song without pausing in between. Instead of letting the energy die down they continue to hype up the crowd by never stopping. I remark that they are so on point, to a T, not a single hair out of place on Ryan, the lead singer’s, head. </p>
                  				<p>The song ends, a spotlight shines down on Ryan, isolating him in the darkness and he addresses the crowd. “It’s so nice to be here today, with all of you humans gathered here on this planet, experiencing the music and the love,” he trails on.</p>
                  				<p>“My friend says that when you talk to him one on one, you get the feeling he thinks he’s an alien,” Feather tells me. I get the feeling she’s right, perhaps they’re an experiment of the Watermelon Cult gone horribly well!</p>
                  				<p>Mother Mother displays a level of detached seriousness just not found in human bands. If Jesse Roper is the epitome of a fun loving, wild, band of buddies, than Mother Mother is like a band of rocking robots.</p>
                  				<p>They play song after song with deadly efficiency and charisma.</p>
                  				<p>Mother Mother is the perfect band to end the melon gathering that is Rifflandia 2015, a spell of love and enthusiasm is cast upon the crowd. I feel it flow down my arm, into my hand, and up through Feather.</p>
                  				<p>We look at each other, smile, then kiss, fireworks go off behind us. Mother Mother’s lead singer smiles at having accomplished his mission and the lights go dark.</p>
                  				<br>
                  				<p>The festival is over.</p>
